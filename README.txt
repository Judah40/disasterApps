#### PROJECT TITLE
Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) Terminology in Sierra Leone

#### PROJECT DESCRIPTION
DRR app is a mobile application developed with React Native, and adapts functionality and design well for both Andriod and iOS devices of various screen sizes. 
The purpose of this project is to serve as a tool for the implementation of educational strategies by local organisations in Sierra Leone. 
It supports the establishment of common understanding of essential terminology among Sierra Leone's multilingual communities. 
It helps trainers and teachers reach communities of diverse language speakers including the non-literate parts of the
population to help better prepare for future crisis and disaster.
